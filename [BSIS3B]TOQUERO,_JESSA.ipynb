        "* Prediction App is about the crop recommendation machine learning based on the required input in croprecom.py file\n",
        "* Sentiment Analyzer is about the emotion identifier of information input of how you feel or what have will you do, etc. in analyzer.py file\n",

        "##### 👨‍🔧 What I have Learned\n",
        "\n",
        " Machine learning has a rich history spanning several decades. It began in the 1940s-1950s with the foundation of AI and the introduction of neural networks by Frank Rosenblatt.\n",
        "        The 1950s-1960s saw symbolic AI using explicit rules and logic, with early programs like the Logic Theorist. From the 1960s-1980s, machine learning algorithms emerged, including the nearest neighbor algorithm and the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks. Despite an \"AI Winter\" in the 1970s-1980s, foundational work continued. The 1990s brought a resurgence with statistical methods like SVMs and ensemble methods.\n",
        "        The 2000s-2010s marked the deep learning revolution with CNNs and RNNs, significantly advancing image and sequence data processing. By the 2010s, machine learning became crucial in various fields, aided by frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n",
        "        Key figures include Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, pioneers in deep learning. Today, machine learning continues to evolve rapidly, driving innovation across numerous applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "        ### Purpose of Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "        The purpose of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "        It aims to create systems that can automatically improve their performance over time through experience. Machine learning is used to recognize patterns, classify information, and make forecasts based on data. It helps in automating tasks, enhancing efficiency, and providing insights in various fields such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and technology. By leveraging algorithms and statistical models, machine learning enables the development of intelligent applications that can adapt and respond to new data, ultimately driving innovation and solving complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "        ### Usage of Machine Learning\n",
        "        Machine learning is used across various industries and applications, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Healthcare: Machine learning is used to analyze medical data for diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing treatment plans.\n",
        "        * Entertainment: It powers recommendation systems for streaming services, helping to suggest movies, shows, and music tailored to individual preferences.\n",
        "        * Transportation: Machine learning enhances autonomous driving technologies, optimizing routes, and improving safety through predictive maintenance and traffic management.\n",
        "        * Retail: Machine learning helps in demand forecasting, personalized marketing, and inventory management, enhancing customer experience and sales.\n",
        "        * Manufacturing: It enables predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization, improving efficiency and reducing downtime.\n",
        "        * Business: It is used for financial analysis, fraud detection, and customer relationship management, driving better decision-making and operational efficiency.\n",
